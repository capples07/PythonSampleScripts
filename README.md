Example of some Python scripts that I've written.
These scripts are based on work-related challenges that I've solved (with any sensitive information stripped out):
pdf_data_extract_postgres_example.py
s3_attachment_upload_example.py
smartsheet_api_example.py

The below script was an at home project testing pulling data down from a weather api, transforming the data, and loading to MSSQL:
weather_api_to_mssql.py
